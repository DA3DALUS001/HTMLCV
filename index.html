							<div class="job">
								<h2>Rinse FM, London</h2>
								<h3>Producer assistant</h3>
								<h4>July 2018 unpaid work experience</h4>
								<p>
									had the amazing opportunity to gain workplace experience with Rinse FM a large radio broadcasting
									company. With outstanding feedback during the time I volunteered there, I was tasked with the role of social
									media analyst and producer assistant. My role was to note and advise the times in which the target audience
									was most likely to see released and upcoming content. This influenced how many listeners tuned in to shows
									or attended Parties with well-known artists such as Skepta and Katy B to name a few.

								<h2>The North Face, Bluewater</h2>
								<h3>Sales Team</h3>
								<h4>July 2019 - August 2021 </h4>
								<p>
									Working at The North Face from 2019 to 2021 was an incredible opportunity and one I am grateful to have
									had. Working with the team at the North Face Bluewater throughout the duration of my employment taught
									me a great deal about the inner workings of a business. My employment here also encouraged me to
									drastically develop my social skills such as confidence around others and proper professional etiquette when
									it comes to interaction with customers. It was a wonderful experience that taught me many new skills and
									allowed me to mature greatly in an excellent beginning to my professional career.

								<h2>The Duke Of Edinburgh Award</h2>
								<h3>Bronze Award - Brecon Beacons, Wales</h3>
								<h4>2004-2005</h4>
								<p>Quote of completion letter from award leader Kevin Nutter:</p>
								<p>"Taylor set a challenging goal for the bronze expedition, taking part in wild country (Brecon Beacons, Wales) normally associated with the Gold expedition. The aim was to promote DofE to other sudents by producing promotional pictures, commentary, film or presentation. I can confirm that he met all the requirments of the Bronze Expedition award. He completed their aim and principles, met appropriate timescales, spent at least 50% of their planned activity walking whilst observing the twenty expedition rules throughout the duration of the expedition. He was part of a six-person team that I assessed. Consistently througout my observation he demonstrated leadership and teamwork skills to a high standard. Qualities which I am sure will greatly support him in all aspects of his life. He demonstrated excellent understanding of camp craft, cooking and navigation. He has a good level of physical fitness which prepared him well for challenging environment and the duration of the challenge. A mature and capable young man, he presented himself well and proved a valuable asset to a team, capable of taking on leadership role when needed."</p>
								<p>"May I take this oppurtunity to congratulate him on a truly remarkable achievment and hope that this is one of the many great adventures he udertakes. I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors."</p>
